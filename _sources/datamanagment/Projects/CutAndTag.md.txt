## Project History

* 2023
  * February
    * Started to reproduce the tutorial, stopped when we got the sequencing data on the machine
    * Not sure yet the fraction of the analysis part that actually needs Z-fishator
      * Need to test with the Zebrafish data to see if it is manageable on a laptop
    * Got the Zebrafish sequencing data on Z-fishator
  * January:
    * Got a `conda` environment with all the tools running on Z-fishator
      * took a while to solve strange dependencies issues
