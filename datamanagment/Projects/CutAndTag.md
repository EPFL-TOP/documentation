## Project History
* 2023
    * February
        * Started to reproduce the tutorial, stopped when we got the sequencing data on the machine
        * Not sure yet the fraction of the analysis part that actually needs Z-fishator
    * January: 
        * Got a `conda` environment with all the tools running on Z-fishator
            * Took a while to solve strage dependencies issues
