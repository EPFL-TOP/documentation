# Embryos Quality Monitoring (EQM)

## Project summary

* **Status:** Ongoing
* **Goals:**
  * Monitor the zebra fish embryos quality to spot correlations in defects
  * Potentially help the fish facility with a setting up a long term solution
* **Contributors:** Chlo√©, Laurel
* **Starting date:** Dec. 2022
* **Tools involved:** PyRat
* **Project documentation** [Add link once created]

--------

## Project issues/caveats

* PyRat exports do not provide history. Very difficult to track changes in tanks as tank situation might have changed between two exports
* Need access to more fish facility users if we want to perform fish tank monitoring

--------

## Project TODO list

* Add amount of food per fish
* Consolidate the history between tanks such that the amount of food given corresponds to the actual number of fishes in the tank
* Send a summary of the discussion (24/01/2023) to Scionics to put some pressure

## Project History

* 2023
  * February:
    * Email from Guillaume with the protocol details on how to screen the embryos screening
    * Waiting for the first data to be added to Pyrat
    * Two entries from the fish facility, but I lost my access to export other data than the lab data...
    * Brainstorm about the usage of the same

  * January:
    * Discussion with Scionics about implementation of missing features and SV-IT deployment
      * Still a sever side issue at EPFL (python versions) thus running old PyRat version
      * Export to different format to keep tank history, status of API
      * Very disappointing discussion, does not look like a company that provides a commercial tool. They will come back to us within 15 days
    * Guillaume confirmed that Florian will be in charge of scoring the embryos
      * Agreed during lab meeting about the common severity notation
      * Guillaume Valentin agreed to use wildtype lines frequently crossed to provide us with a benchmark dataset
      * Brainstormed about the severity notation (e.g. 2x1:4x2:1x3:ydm)
      * Analyzed the first cross with embryo quality entered in PyRat by users

* 2022
  * November-December
    * Prototype code ready to read PyRat ```csv``` exports
    * Match ```tankID``` and ```crossingID``` database to extract information
    * Push the results to a google sheet
