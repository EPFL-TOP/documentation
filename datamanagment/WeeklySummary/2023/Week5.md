# Week 5 (Jan. 30)
* [[DLEC]](DLEC_project) Deep Learning Embryo Classification
  * Setup a dedicated Deep Learning environment on [[ZF]](ZF_project)
  * Prototype code running with 2 images (treated, non-treated)
    * Classification works!
* [[EQM]](EQM_project) Embryo Quality Monitoring 
   * Guillaume sent us the protocol by email
* [[HMRC]](HMRC_project) HIVE Maintenance Restructuration Cleaning
  * Continue to brainstorm on HIVE structure.
* [[ZED]](ZED_project) Zebrafish Embryos Demultiplexing 
  * Converge with Cristina on an analysis plan towards the lab meeting Feb. 14
    * Reproduce souporcell demultiplexing published results (contacts with authors)
    * Demonstrates souporcells works with labeled cells from embryos (wait reply from Loic)
* [[ZF]](ZF_project) Z-Fishator
   * Found out that there is already a 2TB (unmounted) disk on z-fishator, no need to buy one
   * Continue with machine configuration with setting up specific environments for all users

* (RCT) Discussion with Willi about cell the usage of real time cell tracking and cell state evaluation (to disturb the system at a precise time).




action items:

* (DLEC) Wait images from the VAST next weeks and start a real training
