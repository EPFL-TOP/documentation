# Week 5 (Jan. 30)

**[[CAT]](CAT_project) Cut And Tag**
   * Started to reproduce the workflow

--------------

**[[DLEC]](DLEC_project) Deep Learning Embryo Classification**
  * Setup a dedicated Deep Learning environment on [[ZF]](ZF_project)
  * Prototype code running with 2 images (treated, non-treated)
    * Classification works!
  * **Action items:**
    * Wait images from the VAST next weeks and start a real training. Need at least two categories

--------------

**[[DOC]](DOC_project) Documentation**
  * Converged on using the same infrastructure for data management status reports and lab documentation (this website)
  * Started to document what was done the past two months

--------------

**[[EQM]](EQM_project) Embryo Quality Monitoring** 
   * Guillaume sent us the protocol by email with the details about the screening procedure
      * Waiting for the first data to be added to Pyrat

--------------

**[[HMRC]](HMRC_project) HIVE Maintenance Restructuration Cleaning**
  * Continue to brainstorm on HIVE structure
      * Need to clearly separate the lab users from invited users
      * Need a convention for storing videos and subsequent analyses
      * Need a first convention on user metadata

--------------

**[[RTCT]](RTCT_project) Real-Time Cell Tracking**
   * Discussion with Willi about the usage of real time cell tracking and cell state evaluation (to disturb the system at a precise time)
   * Decided to name the project RTCT (Real-Time Cell Tracking)
* **Action items:**
   * Continue to explore possibilites wih FIJI and Napari


--------------

**[[ZED]](ZED_project) Zebrafish Embryos Demultiplexing**
  * Converge with Cristina on an analysis plan towards the lab meeting Feb. 14
    * Reproduce souporcell demultiplexing published results (contacts with authors)
    * Demonstrates souporcells works with labeled cells from embryos (wait reply from Loic)

--------------

**[[ZF]](ZF_project) Z-Fishator**
   * Found out that there is already a 2TB (unmounted) disk on z-fishator, no need to buy one
   * Continue with machine configuration with setting up specific environments for all users
   * Thinking about connecting the machine to the HIVE
* **Action items:**
   * Investigate the possibility to physically connect the HIVE and Z-Fishator linux machine with optical fiber
