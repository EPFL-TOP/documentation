# Points of discussion

## Ongoing

1. Need a server to store browsable information:
    * For example needed by [Embryo Quality Monitoring](EQM_project), but many other projects could benefit from it.
    * Talked to SV-IT already in November but no agreement was found
    * Tempted to install nginx or Apache server on Z-fishator

--------

2. Documentation (this site) leaves on GitHub public content:
    * It is thus accessible by anyone
    * It is possible to make it private, but we would need to pay quite a lot of money for many services we will not use
    * If we setup a server on Z-fishator, could consider using it to also host the documentation

--------

3. Access to Pyrat data
    * I currently only have access to the lab entries
    * If we want to perform monitoring at larger scale, would need to extend my credentials
    * Not sure if the fish facility admins will like this idea

--------

4. HIVE roles wrt Olaf
    * Need to clarify the situation with Olaf, organise a chat?

--------

## Addressed
