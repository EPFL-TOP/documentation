# Indico Meetings

:::{admonition} Prerequisites
:class: prereq
Before being able to connect to indico meetings, you should create a CERN external account. For that:
1. please visit the CERN authentification page here [here](https://auth.cern.ch/), and login in with "Home organisation - eduGAIN", EPFL should be part of the list of institutes
2. Visit the indico main page [here](https://indico.cern.ch) and click on "login on the top right" to connect your CERN account to indico.
3. Contact one of the category manager (Clement for example) and ask him to link your newly created indico account to the Timing Oscillators Patterns Lab sub-category (only the list authorised people can see this sub-category)
4. Once this is done, you can access the Timing Oscillators Patterns Lab category [here](https://indico.cern.ch/category/16214/)

## Live notes
For taking notes during the meetigns we use hedgedoc [live notes](https://demo.hedgedoc.org/). We will always use the same live note, it will be linked from the indico agenda. Once we have all converged on collaborative editing, the live note content of the meeting will be archieved, see [next section](#meeting-notes-archives). To start a new note, just replace the live note content (once archived) by the [meeting_template.md](https://github.com/EPFL-STD/documentation/blob/main/meetings/meeting_template.md).
