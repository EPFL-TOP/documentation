## Main topic

### General comments

1. 40mins, good for a "trained" audience, might not be the case for the thesis commitee
2. Each slide must have a title and a page number
3. Give more citations along the way, to give more context and to show the jury you know what you are talking about
4. Shorten maybe the first part to show less data(pulled data?)
5. Still not trivial to do such experiement, should make it clear that is the case. Highlight the discovery in the figures
6. Useful to have some small introduction (phase transition?)
7. Good strategy to explain the plots, look at the wild type, look at the blur picture
